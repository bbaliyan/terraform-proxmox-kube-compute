# proxmox-control-plane

Provisions the control-plane node(s) for a single-cluster RKE2 deployment on Proxmox.

## Join tokens and firewall ipset naming

This module generates its own cluster join tokens (`random_password` resources) and
exposes them as the `cluster_token`/`cluster_agent_token` outputs — there is no
separate cluster-facts unit to pre-generate them. `cluster_token` is consumed by this
module's own `node-bootstrap` calls (server-init and server-join alike);
`cluster_agent_token` is meant to be handed to `proxmox-node-pool`'s own
`cluster_agent_token` input by the consumer's Terragrunt config. There is no
Terraform-level dependency between the two sibling modules — only a value passed
through at that layer.

Similarly, the cluster-wide and etcd-peer firewall ipset names
(`kube-compute-<cluster_name>-cluster` / `-etcd`) are a plain deterministic-string
convention computed locally from `cluster_name`, not a shared output. `proxmox-node-pool`
computes the same formula independently to reference the cluster ipset by name.

## Operational note: SSH connection bursts on apply

The `proxmox_virtual_environment_file` resources here (`vendor_data`, `node_init`,
`network_data`) upload cloud-init snippets via SSH — this is how the `bpg/proxmox`
provider handles snippet uploads, not something this module controls. Each upload opens
its own SSH connection, and OpenTofu's default per-unit parallelism (10) means a single
`apply` can already burst close to that many connections at once.

If a consumer applies this module concurrently with another unit that also does SSH
uploads — most commonly `proxmox-node-pool` against the same cluster — the combined
burst can exceed the Proxmox host's SSH daemon `MaxStartups` (OpenSSH default
`10:30:100`: begin randomly dropping unauthenticated connections once 10 are open at
once). The failure surfaces as a `bpg/proxmox` SSH auth error on an otherwise-valid
key/token (`ssh: unable to authenticate ... no supported methods remain`), lands on an
arbitrary resource, and is non-deterministic — some uploads in the same apply succeed,
others don't.

Two independent mitigations, not mutually exclusive:

- **Cap OpenTofu's per-unit parallelism** (e.g. `-parallelism=8` via consumer
  Terragrunt config). Only bounds a single unit — doesn't prevent two units applying
  concurrently from together exceeding the host's threshold.
- **Raise the Proxmox host's `MaxStartups`** in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` (e.g.
  `MaxStartups 60:30:200`), then `sshd -t && systemctl reload ssh`. Scales with however
  many units a consumer applies concurrently, at the cost of a change outside version
  control on the Proxmox host itself.

Consumers that apply multiple Proxmox units concurrently (e.g. via a `run --all`-style
orchestrator) should expect to need the host-side change.

### Booting from a kube-image template

**A `proxmox_template_vm_id` template is now effectively required for a working
cluster.** `node-bootstrap`'s cloud-init payload no longer installs RKE2 — it only
configures and starts it, assuming the binaries are already on disk. That assumption
only holds for a kube-image-baked template. Setting `os_image_url`/`os_image_file_id`
alone (the plain stock-cloud-image path) still creates a VM and still
validates/applies cleanly, but the node fails at
`systemctl enable --now rke2-server.service` during first-boot cloud-init —
`tofu apply` reports success while the cluster never actually comes up. Same cause on
every provider (no more live Ansible install step anywhere in `node-bootstrap` — see
`../node-bootstrap/README.md`). `os_image_url`/`os_image_file_id` remain valid
Terraform-level inputs for a plain, non-RKE2 VM; only "boot a working RKE2 node from a
stock image" is gone.

Set `proxmox_template_vm_id` to a pre-baked kube-image VM template's ID instead of
`os_image_url`/`os_image_file_id`. Nodes are **full**-cloned from it, so they never
depend on the template surviving. The template carries OS prep, the RKE2 binaries
(both server and agent units — the role is chosen at launch), the SELinux policy, the
kernel modules, and the guest agent; this module supplies only per-cluster identity,
secrets, and join logic, as a cloud-init payload rendered by `node-bootstrap`.
Bootstrap runs asynchronously after `tofu apply` returns — tail
`/var/log/kube-compute-bootstrap.log` on the node to watch it. No compatibility check
is made between the template's contents and `k8s_version`/`cilium_version`/
`argocd_version`; the template's self-describing name is the documentation.

Changing any of `node-bootstrap`'s inputs (a rotated token, a new registry mirror, a
different platform revision) after a node's first boot has no effect on that
already-running node — cloud-init only ever reads its user-data once, on first boot,
and the rendered snippet file is stable/reused rather than triggering a VM
replacement. Day-2 config changes need a new node (replace), not a `tofu apply` on the
existing one.
