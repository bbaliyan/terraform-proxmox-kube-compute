# proxmox-cluster

A thin wrapper that composes [`proxmox-control-plane`](../proxmox-control-plane/README.md)
and [`proxmox-node-pool`](../proxmox-node-pool/README.md) into a single Terraform state,
for operators who want one Terragrunt directory per cluster instead of today's split
`control-plane/` + `node-pools/*` layout. It changes nothing about either composed
module internally — it only calls them from one place.

## Single state, single lock

This module puts the control plane and every worker pool in **one Terraform state
with one lock**. That buys a single `terragrunt apply` per cluster, at a real cost:
you can no longer apply `control-plane` and a node pool concurrently from separate
terminals — every change serializes through the one state/lock. If your workflow
depends on applying a worker pool while a separate control-plane change is in
flight, stay on the split `proxmox-control-plane` + `proxmox-node-pool` layout
instead (see below).

## Inputs

Every input `proxmox-control-plane` accepts is available unchanged — same name,
type, default, and validation — at this module's own top level. See
[`proxmox-control-plane`'s README](../proxmox-control-plane/README.md) and its
`variables.tf` for the full list and field-by-field semantics; this module does not
re-document them.

`node_pools` is a map of worker pools keyed by pool name (e.g. `"platform"`). Each
entry's fields mirror `proxmox-node-pool`'s own `variables.tf`, minus what this module
supplies: `cluster_name`, `cluster_agent_token`, and the key itself as `pool_name`. An
empty map (the default) creates no worker pools, the same shape as applying
`proxmox-control-plane` alone.

Every worker of a pool is named `<cluster_name>-<pool>-<n>` and carries
`kube-compute.io/node-group=<pool>`. `node_taints` keeps other pods off; pods that
belong there need a matching toleration. A pool field left null takes the cluster's own
value: `trusted_ca_pem`, `registry_mirror_url`, `ssh_authorized_keys`, `dns_servers`,
`vm_gateway`, and the DNS registration settings.

## Platform pool

`platform_node_group` names the pool that runs the platform stack:

- its components are pinned to that pool;
- it alone opens `ingress_ports` to `allowed_ingress_cidrs`, since Traefik runs there,
  and the control plane keeps only 6443;
- the wildcard DNS record points at its workers.

Without it, ingress and the wildcard record stay on the control plane of an
`all_in_one` cluster, and on the pools of a `dedicated_control_plane` one.

### DNS registration

Unlike some earlier revisions of this module, there's no `provider "dns" {}` to
wire up — DNS registration (`dns_server_address`/`tsig_key_*`) is plain module
input, and the underlying `dns-registration` module shells out to `nsupdate`
rather than using a Terraform provider (see its README for why). It just needs
`nsupdate` (`bind-utils`/`dnsutils`) installed on whatever machine runs
`tofu apply`/`tofu destroy`.

## Usage: control-plane only, no worker pools

```hcl
module "cluster" {
  source = "path/to/kube-compute/modules/proxmox-cluster"

  cluster_name          = "example"
  proxmox_node           = "pve-01"
  vm_cores               = 4
  vm_memory_mb            = 8192
  vm_disk_gb              = 60
  allowed_ingress_cidrs   = ["10.0.0.0/24"]
  proxmox_template_vm_id  = 9000
}
```

This is equivalent to today's `control-plane/` unit alone — `node_pools` defaults to
`{}`, so no `proxmox-node-pool` instances are created.

## Usage: control plane plus a worker pool

```hcl
module "cluster" {
  source = "path/to/kube-compute/modules/proxmox-cluster"

  cluster_name           = "example"
  cluster_type           = "dedicated_control_plane"
  proxmox_node           = "pve-01"
  vm_cores               = 4
  vm_memory_mb           = 8192
  vm_disk_gb             = 60
  allowed_ingress_cidrs  = ["10.0.0.0/24"]
  proxmox_template_vm_id = 9000
  cluster_network_cidr   = "10.0.0.0/24"
  platform_node_group    = "platform"

  node_pools = {
    platform = {
      proxmox_node           = "pve-01"
      vm_cores               = 4
      vm_memory_mb           = 16384
      vm_disk_gb             = 100
      proxmox_template_vm_id = 9000
      desired_count          = 1
      registration_address   = "10.0.0.5"
    }
    batch = {
      proxmox_node           = "pve-01"
      vm_cores               = 8
      vm_memory_mb           = 32768
      vm_disk_gb             = 100
      proxmox_template_vm_id = 9000
      desired_count          = 2
      registration_address   = "10.0.0.5"
      node_taints            = ["dedicated=batch:NoSchedule"]
    }
  }
}
```

Each key in `node_pools` becomes one `proxmox-node-pool` instance, wired to this
cluster's `cluster_name` and `cluster_agent_token` automatically.

## Cluster autoscaler (optional)

This module — not `proxmox-control-plane` or `node-bootstrap` — owns
`cluster_autoscaler_enabled`, `cluster_autoscaler_worker_min_size`,
`cluster_autoscaler_worker_max_size`, and `cluster_autoscaler_worker_template`.
`false` (the default) is a no-op: no CAPI install, no `MachineDeployment`, no
change to what this module already provisions.

When enabled, this module:

- Renders a `Cluster` + `Secret` + `ProxmoxMachineTemplate` + `MachineDeployment`
  bundle (`templates/cluster-autoscaler-workers.yaml.tftpl`) — no
  `RKE2ConfigTemplate`/CAPRKE2 anywhere in it. Workers join via a plain `Secret`
  referenced by `Machine.spec.bootstrap.dataSecretName`; the `Secret`'s content
  is this project's own worker cloud-init, rendered by a second, dedicated
  `node-bootstrap` instantiation (`module.cluster_autoscaler_worker_bootstrap`,
  `set_hostname = false` — the payload is shared byte-for-byte across every
  `MachineDeployment` replica, so it cannot carry a node-unique hostname;
  CAPMOX's own per-VM metadata is relied on instead, unverified against real
  hardware).
- Passes the rendered bundle through to `proxmox-control-plane` as a single
  `genesis_apply_manifests` entry (a generic node-bootstrap mechanism — see
  [`node-bootstrap`'s README](../node-bootstrap/README.md#genesis-apply-manifests-generic-cluster-autoscaler-is-the-one-caller-today)),
  with `cluster_autoscaler_crd_wait_enabled = true` so `bootstrap.sh` waits for
  CAPI's core CRDs before applying it. `proxmox-control-plane`/`node-bootstrap`
  have no cluster-autoscaler-specific code left in them.
  `proxmox_template_vm_id` for `cluster_autoscaler_worker_template` points at
  the **same** kube-image template used everywhere else in this module — only
  one image variant exists.
- Merges a `clusterAutoscalerEnabled` Helm parameter into
  `platform_extra_helm_parameters`, which is what gates kube-platform's own
  `cluster-autoscaler` Argo CD Application.
- Requires `cluster_domain` and `dns_server_address` to both be set — autoscaled
  workers join through the genesis node's self-registered DNS name
  (`genesis.<cluster_name>.<cluster_domain>`), the same single-target address
  `proxmox-node-pool`'s own workers default to, computed independently here to
  avoid a dependency cycle through the control plane's own cloud-init render.
  Enforced by a `check` block, not a hard `plan`-time error.

`cluster_autoscaler_worker_max_size` must be greater than its `0` default, and
`cluster_autoscaler_worker_template` must be set; both are enforced by `plan`-time
validation so an incomplete configuration fails with a clear error rather than
producing a `MachineDeployment` that can never scale.

## Existing standalone modules remain fully supported

`proxmox-control-plane` and `proxmox-node-pool` are unchanged and continue to work
exactly as before, applied as separate Terragrunt units with a `dependency` block
carrying `cluster_agent_token` between them. `proxmox-cluster` is an additional
option for consumers who want a single directory/state per cluster — it does not
deprecate, replace, or require migrating the split layout.
